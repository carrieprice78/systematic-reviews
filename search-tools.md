# Search Tools

Some of these tools help iterate the search process while others help users search platforms.

* [2Dsearch](https://app.2dsearch.com/)
2Dsearch is a radical alternative to conventional 'advanced search'. Instead of entering Boolean strings into one-dimensional search boxes, queries are formulated by combining objects on a two-dimensional canvas. This eliminates syntax errors, makes the query semantics more transparent, and offers a more effective way to optimize, save and share search strategies.

* [BioReader](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BioReader/)
BioReader can help you distill your reading list by ranking articles by relevance. Simply collect the PubMed IDs of a number of articles you found relevant and a similar number of articles not relevant to you. BioReader will provide you with a ranked reading list to limit the time wasted on reading irrelevant literature.

* [Medxrivr](https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/medrxivr/)
Medxrivr allows you to perform advanced search and batch export in Medrxiv. Documentation is available on [GitHub](https://mcguinlu.github.io/medrxivr/index.html).

* [MeSH on Demand](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/MeSHonDemand)
MeSH on Demand identifies MeSHÂ® terms in your submitted text (abstract or manuscript). MeSH on Demand also lists PubMed similar articles relevant to your submitted text.

* [Publibee](https://www.publibee.com)
Publibee is a platform developed by Stanford University individuals that uses PubMed data and maintains Legacy PubMed functionality.

* [PubReMiner](https://hgserver2.amc.nl/cgi-bin/miner/miner2.cgi)
PubReMiner will query PubMed with your specified search query, get all abstracts and generate frequency tables.

* [PubVenn](https://pubvenn.appspot.com/)
PubVenn enables you to explore PubMed using venn diagrams.

* [Yale MeSH Analyzer](http://mesh.med.yale.edu/)
Librarians have long analyzed Medical Subject Headings to design and refine searches. A MeSH analysis grid can help identify the problems in your search strategy by presenting the ways articles are indexed in the MEDLINE database in an easy-to-scan tabular format.
