# Search Iterations



* [2Dsearch](https://app.2dsearch.com/)
2Dsearch is a radical alternative to conventional 'advanced search'. Instead of entering Boolean strings into one-dimensional search boxes, queries are formulated by combining objects on a two-dimensional canvas. This eliminates syntax errors, makes the query semantics more transparent, and offers a more effective way to optimize, save and share search strategies.

* [BioReader](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BioReader/)
BioReader can help you distill your reading list by ranking articles by relevance. Simply collect the PubMed IDs of a number of articles you found relevant and a similar number of articles not relevant to you. BioReader will provide you with a ranked reading list to limit the time wasted on reading irrelevant literature.



* [MeSH on Demand](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/MeSHonDemand)
MeSH on Demand identifies MeSHÂ® terms in your submitted text (abstract or manuscript). MeSH on Demand also lists PubMed similar articles relevant to your submitted text.



* [PubReMiner](https://hgserver2.amc.nl/cgi-bin/miner/miner2.cgi)
PubReMiner will query PubMed with your specified search query, get all abstracts and generate frequency tables.

* [PubVenn](https://pubvenn.appspot.com/)
PubVenn enables you to explore PubMed using venn diagrams.

* [Yale MeSH Analyzer](http://mesh.med.yale.edu/)
Librarians have long analyzed Medical Subject Headings to design and refine searches. A MeSH analysis grid can help identify the problems in your search strategy by presenting the ways articles are indexed in the MEDLINE database in an easy-to-scan tabular format.

# Search Platforms

* [Medxrivr](https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/medrxivr/)
Medxrivr allows you to perform advanced search and batch export in Medrxiv. Documentation is available on [GitHub](https://mcguinlu.github.io/medrxivr/index.html).

* [Publibee](https://www.publibee.com)
Publibee is a platform developed by Stanford University individuals that uses PubMed data and maintains Legacy PubMed functionality.

# Search Translators

* [MEDLINE Transpose](https://medlinetranspose.github.io/)
MEDLINE Transpose was developed to mitigate a common problem among information specialists: converting search syntax between PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE interfaces.

* [Polyglot Search via SR Accelerator](http://sr-accelerator.com/#/polyglot)
The IEBH SR-Accelerator is a suite of tools to speed up steps in the Systematic Review (SR) process. It is freely available for anyone in the world to use. Simply register below with your name and email address. The SRA is a modular design which means the tools can be incorporated into existing SR workflows and combined with other automation tools.
