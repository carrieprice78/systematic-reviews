* [GRADE Working Group](http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/index.htm): The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (short GRADE) working group began in the year 2000 as an informal collaboration of people with an interest in addressing the shortcomings of grading systems in health care.
